# Create a Schematic

Schematic is a symbol diagram of electronic circuits. We need this to define layouts, routing, and component symbols.

## MCU Schematic

Before we jump in, there are two main alternatives for MCU, ATMEGA32U4 or Raspberry Pi RP2040. While we will working with either **Raspberry Pi Pico** development board or **Waveshare Zero** development board, **Arduino Pro Micro** also have similar steps.

:::info

To begin with **ATMEGA32U4**, you can continue to <a href="https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/pcb-guide-part-3---creating-the-mcu-schematic" target="_blank">ai03 - PCB Guide</a> and for **RP2040**, continue to [Hardware Design with RP2040 Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf)
