# About Sendy

I am a highly skilled web frontend developer based in Indonesia, passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites that provide an exceptional user experience. In addition to my professional work, I also enjoy building mechanical keyboards in my free time, as I find creating something from scratch incredibly rewarding.

Currently, I am working at Gojek as a Web Frontend Developer, where I am responsible for designing and developing user interfaces that are intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing. I work closely with other development team members to ensure that our products meet the highest quality and functionality standards.

In addition to my work at Gojek, I am a designer at Keyboard Kasep, where I specialize in building ergonomic mechanical keyboards that are stylish and comfortable to use. I am passionate about creating products that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and practical.

Overall, I am a dedicated and hardworking professional committed to delivering exceptional results in everything I do. Whether working on a website or building a keyboard, I always strive to exceed expectations and provide the best possible outcome for my clients and customers.
